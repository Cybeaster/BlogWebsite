Building a blog starter can feel like overkill until you need it. This project gives you:

- Fully typed content loading from local markdown files.
- Static routes for a home page, blog index, and detail views.
- Simple UX patterns that are easy to customize.

Because posts live alongside your codebase, you can version them, review them, and ship them like any other feature. Clone, edit, publish.
