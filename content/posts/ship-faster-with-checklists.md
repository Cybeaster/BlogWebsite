A launch checklist keeps tiny mistakes from snowballing into late-night fire drills. Mine is short:

1. Run lint + build locally.
2. Re-read the post in the deployed preview.
3. Verify OpenGraph cards render the way you expect.
4. Schedule social posts *after* the deploy is live.

The hardest part about publishing regularly is context switching. A checklist removes decision fatigue so you can focus on the words.
